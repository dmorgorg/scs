<p>I had hoped for a rest day after the previous day's efforts but, being Saturday night, my hotel was fully booked. I booked a hotel a short distance on. So, a semi-rest day.</p>
<p>I woke early but was in no rush so slept some more. Then a leisurely breakfast &ndash; tortilla, ham on a slice of bread, and two large caf&eacute;s con leche. I finally got on with my ride at about 1:30 pm. </p>

<p>A more relaxed landscape south of the pass but very pleasant nonetheless. Long sleeves today since my arms were a bit red from the long day yesterday. Probably drier here but still, at this time of year, quite green. </p>

<p>Quiet roads and quiet lanes. Some uphill, not really necesitating shade breaks but taken anyway. Although my knees and ankle had come through the previous days efforts fairly unscathed, I definitely was suffering from a full-body weariness. The sun felt hot but that might have been due to my general state of low energy.</p>

<p>It was splendid to get horizontal, in the cool of my room. Still no elevator but only on the first floor! I watched Crystal Palace beat Manchester City in the FA Cup Final, and then it was time to head into town to eat. I found a quiet, cheap little bar for a sandwich and a beer. And managed quite fine, with my back (deliberately) to the Eurovision song contest on the TV.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a> offers several route-finding options: any, paved, gravel. The only obvious difference between <em>any</em> and <em>gravel</em> for today's route appeared to be the approach to the Via Verde. I began to doubt my choice of gravel when faced with a kilometre of high grass, occasional muddy puddles. But the puddles weren't too deep or too muddy and I stayed upright. It clearly hadn't been driven or ridden in a while but I managed without embarrassing myself. Not that it would have mattered; there wasn't an audience.</p>

<p>Once on the trail, it was plain sailing. Hard-packed surface. No navigation to contend with: just follow the trail.</p>

  <p>The day was relatively easy physically although my body was feeling the effects of the previous days. It'll take a while to get fitness and strength back into my legs. I'm way behind my levels for this time last year, but I don't have the benefit of a recent tour of Sri Lanka. It'll come. Or it won't. Meanwhile, on I plod! </p>

 <p>I met a cyclist heading the other way and we chatted briefly. He was headed to Villacoya. Fifteen minutes later I discovered, in my pocket, the keys for the hotel in Villacoya. Bad timing, a quarter of an hour earlier and I could have given it to the northbound tourist to deliver. </p>

 <p>I texted the hotel apologetically, asking what they'd like me to do with the keys. They had spares came the reply, not to worry.</p>

  <p>I met Chris, from Santa Fe, New Mexico, outside the hotel in O&ntilde;a. Pleasant company for the evening. He also has a flat in Madrid where he spends five months a year. And may be relocating permanently, given the craziness in his homeland.</p>

  <p>I needed a good rest day. And I wanted to stay in a hotel where Bev and I had had a couple of pleasant nights in Burgos in 2023 but it was booked on the night I wanted so I settled for a second rest day. A wise move, as it turned out: this felt a long day.</p>

  <p>Most cyclists would make it to Burgos (easily?) from O&ntilde;a in a day but that would be 60 km with significant climbing: I didn't feel ready for that. The only place I could find to stay was within 12 km of Burgos but, hopefully, that would get me into Burgos in time to find a coin-laundry. Time for some fresh, clean clothes!</p>

  <p>Today promised to be almost continually uphill, never steep but never easy cruising. I retraced my steps (or pedal strokes) to the Via Verde and got on with it. </p>

<p>It was a bit of a struggle. The surface was fine but definitely more energy-sapping  than smooth tarmac. The kilometres passed slowly. It was very remote and I was using up my water quite quickly - reminding me that I should look for a replacement bottle while in Burgos. </p>

<p>I had no bread so lunch was a tin of mussels in oil. Quite good. And some Laughing Cow fake cheese triangles. Not much energy regained. </p>

  <p>I entered one of the rare villages along the route but it was small and had no store. I could have used some calories, and some water, but no luck here. Although one building did sport an intriguing bicycle 'installation.'</p>

  <p>I went into another 'ghost' village. Was everyone at work? Or having a siesta? (It was almost 5 pm.) I noticed a house with the door open, and a tap outside. I called 'hello' but there was no response. I filled my water-bottles and free-wheeled back down to the trail. Stopping at a bench to rest my bottom that was developing a fierce dislike for my saddle. At the bench, I added some sterilising tablets to my freshly cool water bottles. It was probably not necessary, but...</p>

  <p>A few spots of rain, and a little welcome downhill. Then time to leave the Via Verde and head off to my room for the night. It was eight o'clock when I arrived. The restaurant was some distance away (for a tired old guy to walk in the rain) but the hostess drove there, and then picked me up. I read in the comments on booking.com that they had done that for some other guests; maybe they feel that is necessary to appeal to passing cyclists? </p>

  <p>I delayed my departure from the Hotel Norte y Londres until noon, when I had to check out. It would be another short day and my hotel for the evening had a late check-in. I rode for a couple of kilometres and sat in the sun in a plaza. I had time to kill. But it was chilly.</p>

<p>Before long, I was back on a Via Verde for a short while. A nice surface. Then a turn east to get another trail to my lodgings in Mod&ugrave;bar de San Cibri&agrave;n. Population 68.</p>

      alt="cycle path south of burgos"/>
  <p>Steep, with a strong headwind, made me thankful for the freshly paved surface.</p>

  <p>Despite all the dawdling, I was outside my lodgings by four o'clock. I filled in the online check-in form and sent a message to the lodging, informing then that I was outside the hotel but happy to wait until five. A man walked down the road and let me in a few minutes later.</p>
