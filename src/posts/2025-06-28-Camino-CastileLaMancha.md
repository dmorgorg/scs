<p>A slightly earlier than usual start had me out of the hotel around 9:30 am. I noticed my front tyre was a little soft so tried to add some air. No luck - and I blamed the cheap pump I'd bought in Santander. OK, the tyre was not so soft that I couldn't ride on it...</p>

<p>On the way out of the city, I saw a petrol station and went in to use the air machine. One &euro; for five minutes. But it only took me one to see that no air was going into my tyre. I pressed the 'release' pin on the valve stem and no air came out. The problem was, apparently, with the valve. I poked away at the pin, hoping to dislodge whatever was blocking it. To no avail. </p>

<p>This presented a more challenging problem: if I couldn't let air out of the tyre, how could I remove the tyre to replace the valve? </p>

<blockquote>I clearly wasn't thinking straight. I do have a stem removal tool in my tool kit but that thought never crossed my mind!</blockquote>

<p>I stopped at another petrol station and increased its pressure to 4 bars (about 60 psi) to see if that would clear anything. Nope. (I'm not sure the pressure was any higher coming out of the machine, just when it would cut off.)</p>

<p>Aha! Across the road was an automobile tyre shop. I rode across the forecourt, leaned my bike against the wall, and removed the front wheel. I took it into the front area where, presumably, the manager tried to make sense of my signing and 'explanation.' Basically, a problem with the valve and I couldn't remove air. He took me into the workshop and retrieved a mechanic who appeared to be detailing a car. Maybe his own; it was a quiet Saturday morning. The mechanic discovered what I already had, then got a stem removal tool and unscrewed it. It still didn't want to come out but needle-nose pliers did the trick. I had sunglasses on in a dark workshop so couldn't really look at the stem; I think it was probably gummed up with sealant. The mechanic took the new stem out of one of my spare valves, screwed it in, and inflated the tyre for me. Then dug about in a tray of parts and put a stem in my spare valve so that I still had a working spare.</p>

<p>Wheel back on, bill paid (5&euro;) and I was on my way, much happier, still before 10 am. Nice interactions with friendly people!</p>

<p>For a while I shared the route with the camino although the service road beside the autovia was hardly special. Then the pilgrims' route took off without me. I would stick with tarmac as much as possible.</p>

<p>Then it was my turn to leave the service road and the noisy autovia, onto a fairly smooth road with a bit of traffic but adequate hard shoulders so I didn't feel particularly threatened. Somewhere the camino crossed me again but I missed it.   </p>

<p>The road, despite the traffic, was easier riding than the patched service road and the day was progressing well. At about 12:30, I came to the small town of Alpera and headed in the direction of a bar.</p>

<p>I hadn't breakfasted and food of some sort was required. En route to the bar, I noticed a restaurant with a sign for a menu del dia. Problem solved. Salad, gazpacho and some fish. I'd covered about half the required distance for the day and was well fed.</p>

<p>My after lunch ride was still on tarmac, a smaller road but without a shoulder. Traffic was rare, fortunately. Early afternoon now, and the temperature was rising. But, whether due to rest or to the terrain, I was feeling more up to the day's challenges. The road was quiet enough that I could cross the road for a rest and a drink when an occasional tree offered shade. The hotel I had just left had a fridge in the room so I had started the day with quite cold water but it was warming up now.</p>

<p>Whenever I stopped, it was very peaceful, despite having to swat the bothersome horseflies that took a liking for my lower legs. Oh, and the buzz of flies that congregated whenever I stopped.

<p>There was an 83% chance of 10 mm of rain in the forecast, and cloud did seem to be building to my right. And a regular rumble of thunder, while I was still in the sun. While I didn't really want to be caught in a storm, I would not have minded the cloud cover.</p>

<p>As I climbed, there were copses of pines, and juniper. A sign nailed to one tree forbade the collecting of pine cones. Then a sign to beware of lynxes for the next 5 km. Wouldn't that be a treat? But highly unlikely, I thought, in the middle of a hot afternoon. Only mad dogs and Englishmen...</p>

<p>I rolled into Higueruela and stopped at the first bar, La Garnacha, for a large Heineken. Zero alcohol content! Then pushed my load the remaining 300 m to the hotel. Made it! I'm here for two nights.</p>
