<p>There was a climb up on the road out of Novaleno, winding through pleasant pine forest, until I reached the Via Verde. Which continued in a gentle fashion, slightly but steadily uphill on roughish gravel, spinning easily in a low gear. No stress on the joints and not tiring. Also not fast, but that doesn't need saying.</p>

<p>This continued, although not all uphill, for a couple of hours until, with regret, I left the forest behind. I passed a church and was into open farmland and increased temperatures.</p>

<p>The surface deteriorated, requiring more energy. But it was still enjoyable.</p>

<p>The Via Verde abruptly terminated and I had some steep hill work to get up to Soria. It was the wrong end of the day for this effort but I made it to my hotel.</p>

<p>But the centre of Soria is comprised of historic narrow streets and tightly packed buildings. My hotel had no room for a bike. The hostess suggest a public underground parking lot, which didn't fill me with any confidence. But, she said, it was that or find another hotel. According to booking.com, this hotel had a no cancellation policy but I asked whether I could cancel. She agreed. And I wandered off with my bike. Around the corner, the Alamedo Centro, a more modern building, had room to store my bike. And by not booking through booking, I got quite a reasonable rate. 120&euro; for two nights. </p>

<p>The room was very hot and I didn't seem to be able to work the air conditioning. But I slept without covers, next to an open window. The chattering from the bar below ended at eleven and I had a reasonable night.</p>

<p>In the morning, I got the cleaners in and pointed at the thermostat for some help in what I was doing wrong. The cleaners immediately commented on how hot it was (or signed it, we had little language in common), checked the breaker box (nothing wrong there) and made a phone call. The phone was handed to me and someone told me in English there would be a technician around in 20 minutes. </p>

<p>But the technician, or someone, managed to fix it remotely and soon there was cool air blowing into the room. Which, unfortunately, I had to leave to get to a barber's before they closed at 2:00 pm. Full beard removal was called for (I don't want to end up with a white chin in addition to the white around my eyes from my sunglasses) and a good trim on top. Then a late lunch and a walk to the post office where the very helpful people arranged the sending of the hotel keys back to hotel I had absconded with them from.</p>

<p>It was a hot one. I had about five kilometres on road, with a hill to go over, to reach the Via Verde. I stopped in the shade of a single tree in an open semi-developed industrial wasteland in sight of the gravel pathway. There was no delaying it: it was going to be a long, hot and largely shade-free day. 30 degrees.</p>

<p>The gravel, too, was more gravelly than I had become accustomed to. It made for an energy sapping ride. Two cycle tourists passed me, heading in the opposite direction. I stopped for lunch in the shade of tree. There was nothing to sit on and I felt more comfortable standing. I sliced half a baguette longitudinally and soaked each in oil from a tin of mussels. Surprisingly good! And the mussels themselves were a tasty dessert.</p>

<p>I tried to stay hydrated but I hadn't needed to pee since leaving Soria several hours earlier. It was not the most exciting scenery, open farmland again, no-one about. Occasionally, the N234 could be seen not too far away with steady, if not busy, traffic. But mostly I was alone in a large expanse of empty farmland.</p>

  alt="estacion"

<p>Of course, there was the occasional derelict railway station. The occasional shade of a tree which invariably necessitated a halt. Or the shade of a bridge where the N234 crossed my path.</p>

<p>And then, it was done. Back onto tarmac. A long downhill, with a strong wind springing up. A dark sky ahead, and approaching from behind. Lightning and cracks of thunder. Big spots of rain, enough for me to dig out my raincoat, but not a soaking rain by any means. A long downhill followed by a long uphill, which I pedalled at walking pace. </p>

<p>At the crest of the hill, a sign informed me I was leaving the community of Castilla y Le&oacute;n and the province of Soria. A while later, I was in the community of Calatayud and the province of Zaragoza.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera never lies? In this digital age, that old adage no longer holds true. But here it is the sign that's to blame for confusing this blogger/cyclist.</p> <p>I am in the autonomous community of Aragon, not of Calatayud! I am in the province of Zaragoza, in the community of Aragon. And in the Comunidad de Catalayud, one of twelve comarcas of the province of Zaragoza in the community of Aragon. Simple.</p></blockquote>

<p>Narrow country roads with no traffic. Getting late in the day. Then anothe long downhill and the turnoff to Malanquilla. Steeply up, and I walked this time. Pleasant surroundings, fields and open hillside. Four kilometres and I was in Malanquilla.</p>

<p>My hotel (just an old house converted into separate rooms but very nice) advertised a restaurant. Misleadingly. But there was a bar a minutes walk away where I had dinner.</p>

<p>After the long day, I knew a rest day was warranted. I decided upon two. There seemed little point in racing on (at my decidedly unracing pace). I may or may not make it to Santiago. Does it matter? I don't need to put pressure on myself. Slowly does it. </p>

<p>Narrow streets, no-one around, very quiet. A population of 132 in 2004. Less now, most likely. In my wanderings about, I saw two people. Up to a dozen in the Bar Malanquilla.</p>

<p>These water bottles supposedly deter dogs and cats from peeing on the doorsteps. I have seen them in many rural areas of Spain. They are not, apparently, offerings to thirsty pilgrims or cyclists.</p>
