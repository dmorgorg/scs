  <p>The bus pulled into the familiar Santander bus station on time, at 2215. My hotel was very close, barely one hundred metres away, but it was still a struggle to get my bike there. It was heavy on my shoulder, awkward and required frequent halts. The shoulder strap remained attached, just, although there were some worrying noises as more stitches gave way. It will need attention before the flight home.</p>

<p>I returned the keys to the owner in the mercado below and set off to The Factory for breakfast. All that seemed to be on offer was toast and tomato, and a coffee. Enough to do me for a while. Then back on the cycle path, hoping to reach Vega de Pas, about 38 km away. Quite a distance in my current state of fitness.</p>

<p>I noticed a pump track (I think that's what they're called) after a small town. Adjoining the cycle path. Easily distracted, I stopped.</p>

<p>But it wasn't the pump track that piqued my interest: it was the two structures beside it.
Climbing walls! Easy to access and free. What a lovely idea! There was a bouldering wall, with a cushioned base, and a lead tower. Outdoors, but with some roof shelter from the rain.</p>

<p>I presume petty crime is less of an issue in Spain. I'm not sure how long these expensive plastic climbing holds would remain in place, in the UK or Canada.</p>

<p>The path is a via verde (or greenway), a reclaimed rail track. This particular one that I'm riding is the Via Verde del Pas, 35.5 km in length.</p>

<blockquote>In Spain, there are more than 3,500 kilometers of old lines of disused railroad that have been recovered as itineraries cyclists and hikers within the framework of the Greenways Program that since 1993 has energized and promoted the Foundation of the Spanish Railways F.S.P. <a href="https://viasverdes.com/" alt="via verdes line">(Via Verdes)</blockquote>

<p>There is a discontinuous via verde from Santander to Valencia (Via Verdes FC. Santander - Mediterr&aacute;neo), which I hope to use as much as possible, linking the various sections with navigation help from <a href="https://www.cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a></p>

  <p>A short section of farm double-track through meadows of noisy cattle, bells a jingling. Then on to the A-road to Burgos. Traffic but not too much and something of a shoulder. Slow, with weary muscles, and frequent halts. The saddle wasn't so painful. I wore padded shorts again today. And I dug out my rear light and wore my bright red raincoat. </p>
  <p>Then I turned off onto the road to Vega de Pass, signposted 11 km away. Less shoulder, but quieter. Some traffic but it seemed considerate; it is Spain after all. But it only takes one driver on his phone, inattentive on the quiet road.</p>

<p>Old stone farm buildings on the outskirts of Vega de Pas. Pas is the name of the river I've been alongside for the last couple of days. </p>

<p>A quiet village with nice old buildings. My hotel is a splendid old house, beautifully furnished and maintained. I sat outside on a stone bench for a while before calling the number on the door to let in. Victor arrived in few minutes to let me in. I had booked for two nights but enquired about three.  (The weather looks wet for the next two days and I don't fancy pushing my bike up 800 m to the top of the hill in the rain and cool.) No problem. Then he returned to his lunch with his 100 year old mother. It was his 62nd birthday so his mother had him quite late.</p>
