<p>I breakfasted with a trio of early-sixties-ish Spanish mountain-bikers who had a little English. They had a week away from their wives to drink and ride, and continually asked me how far I rode each day. 40-50 km, I said. We do 100 km, they said. I refrained from reminding them that I was ten years older than them. And the two who seemed proudest of the distance they were achieving were on ebikes. I didn't bring that up, either. But, all in all, a friendly group.</p>

<p>The ride commenced in a slapstick fashion. I rolled downhill out of Malanquilla, and then up the hill in front of the windmill until level with my hotel. I was getting sweaty so pulled over to search for my gloves. They weren't where I normally kept them, nor in my foldable backpack in my handlebar bag. Damn, I must have put them on the window ledge by the bike when I was loading up. Double damn: I'd have to go back down the hill and up to the hotel to retrieve them. Damn, damn, damn!</p>

<p>I let myself in back at the hotel, explained to Pilar (?), the housekeeper, that I'd lost my gloves. Sign language can be wonderfully effective. No, the gloves weren't on the ledge. In the room?, enquired Pilar. I was pretty certain I'd brought them down from my room but went to check. The bed covers were folded over and when I straightened them, what did I see? My gloves? No. My Kindle!</p>

<p>Back at the bike, I noticed my gloves in a side pocket on my handlebar bag! I not so sure about the 'creeping' part of the creeping senility I seem to be subject to!</p>

<p>But, if I'd found my gloves right away, and not returned to the hotel, I'd be now without my Kindle. A much worse outcome than losing my gloves. Something was working in my favour.</p>

<p>I had decided to follow the main N634 (the road to Valencia) most of the way to Calatayud, my destination for the day. I had ridden on it before, without much traffic, and the shoulders were reasonable. The alternative, suggested by the route planner on cycle.travel took me on quieter roads, but the three sides of a rectangle. I thought the direct, single side, of the N634 made more sense, until I reached a short section of Via Verde that would bring me almost to Calatayud.So, it was downhill, along a minor road to the N634, and then more downhill.</p>

<p>There was a strong, blustery wind. And a headwind at that. I had to pedal some to make progress downhill, which didn't seem fair. Still, it was better than pedalling uphill with a strong headwind. In the famous words of Monty Python, "Always look on the bright side of life."</p>

<p>There was plenty of downhill (to be regained tomorrow, I suspected) into the wind. It was a cooler day, 20C, and quite comfortable. The first vines I'd seen this trip. And olive trees, too. Nothing very mature looking so maybe climate change is expanding, or at least moving, the growing area.</p>

<p>The landscape was more interesting, and varied, than it had been for the last couple of days through sun-baked farmland. </p>

<p>I presume that these are to be future olive plantations, judging by the spacing of the 'trees.'</p>

<p>And then, after about 30 km, I reached the turn off for the short section of Via Verde. Roughish gravel, requiring more effort on my part, but it was nice to be off the main road.</p>

<p>This section of trail seemed to have be cut through the surrounding countryside for the prospective train line. The amount of excavating work, removing fill or placing it, in order to keep the gradients gentle, must have been immense.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what is being grown here. Neither grapes nor olives. </p>

<p>And then, at the end of the Via Verde, a few kilometres of road brought me into Calatayud. Ahead of the forecast severe thunderstorm. It did materialize eventually, although it wasn't dramatic.</p>
