<p>La Roda seems a somewhat nondescript small southern Spanish town but it has a pleasant, and inexpensive (36&euro;), centrally located hotel. I decided to spend two nights here: having fully appreciated the strong tailwind today, I didn't want to battle the almost as strong headwind the next day. I might not have been in need of a rest day but I can always find use for one.</p>

<p>I checked the forecast not just for wind but for the temperatures for the next few days. Not good news.</p>

<p>No cooling trend visible. Rather the opposite. Time for a reconsideration of my plans?</p>

<p>Apart from one day, I've been handling the heat reasonably well. Although, no doubt, it is putting more strain on my body. Have I just been lucky?</p>

<p>How much, I wonder do I have in reserve? There is absolutely no-one on the trail, there is little shade, and if something amiss happens &ndash; to the bike or to myself &ndash; things could turn nasty very quickly. Is it time to exercise some discretion? The next few stages seem to be equally devoid of population.</p>

<p>Not immediately but I did come around to the conclusion that giving up on the Camino for now might be prudent. I'd had a good ride, almost 1100 km, and could come back here at a more reasonable time of year. </p>

<blockquote>An old mountaineering acquaintance of mine once told me, after just retreating before a Himalayan summit, that "The only expedition that is a failure is the one you don't return from."</blockquote>

<p>I stayed a few extra days in La Roda while I came up with Plan B. Why not go to Pola de Lena, the small town in Asturias that I thought would make a good home, and get to know it a little better.</p>

<p>Bus or train? The bus would mean bagging my bike. But I'd also have to get back to Albacete to catch the bus to Le&oacute;n or Oviedo, close to Pola de Lena. If I selected <em>Media Distancia</em> trains, I could (apparently) just wheel my bike on and off.</p>

<p>On morning, at reception, I enquired about a repair for the failing straps on my bike bag &ndash; I'd need to do this before my flight home and this seemed a reasonable place to do it. A lady employee was called, she offered to take the bag home during her break, and return it to me at 8:00 pm before she started work again. Wonderful!</p>

<p>I stressed that I wanted it to be strong and I didn't really care what it looked like. Well, it came back looking just fine. And, however hard I tried, she refused to take any payment. She did accept a hug.</p>

<p>There were heat warnings in the news for much of Europe. My brother Chris was escaping London to the relative 30&deg;C cool of Cardiff for a few days. My immediate surroundings showed mid to high thirties everywhere.</p>

<p>There was a <em>Media Distancia</em> train from Albacete to Madrid that stopped in La Roda. I'd have to change stations, and overnight, in Madrid &ndash; unless the first train was on time and if I could travel between stations in thirty minutes (rideWithGPS said 40 minutes). Best get a room for the night, I thought. The next day, I could get an afternoon train to Le&oacute;n, arriving about 9:00 pm. A plan!</p>

<p>But some of the trains were full. It looked like my best bet was to arrive in Madrid on Saturday evening and proceed to Le&oacute;n on Sunday.</p>

<p class="center">And all went according to plan!</p>

<p>I had read, or thought that I had read, that the bikes traveled at the front of the train. Nope, I was directed back to another carriage, the carriage marked on my ticket. Rather than suspend my bike from a hook on the side of the carriage, I strapped it to a handrail. There was still room for people to get by and no-one seemed concerned. </p>

<p>The train rushed effortlessly past dirt roads just like the ones that I had ridden. It didn't look particularly hot out there from the comfortable seat in my air-conditioned carriage but an overhead display indicated otherwise. 40&deg;C at almost eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>I was missing the daily riding routine but not second-guessing my decision to abandon the Camino.</p>

<p>It still felt oppressively hot when the train arrived in Madrid. I loaded the short route to my hotel and set off as it began to darken. </p>
