<p>I figured it was not really necessary to revisit the Cathedral, the starting point of the Camino. I had walked from there a couple of days ago to the hotel where I was now leaving from. </p>

<p>I also figured it was not really necessary to religiously follow the exact path of the Camino. Instead, I headed to the Mediterranean which had felt to far to walk (2.4 miles each way) in the heat the previous day. Why not ride along the coast for a while before turning inland to join the yellow arrows?</p>

<p>It was already hot when I ate breakfast: 27C. But on the bike, the breeze helped. It was fairly easy to get out of town, much of it on dedicated cycle paths and, after about five kilometres, I was at the beach. A line of sun worshippers were arranged along the water's edge, laying out in the sun or under umbrellas. I was back, for a little while, on EuroVelo 8 &ndash; with signs to Cadiz &ndash; and I rode south along the coast, sea on my left and restaurants to my right. </p>

<p>Then my route pulled me away from the sea, on quiet roads through rice fields. Egrets and heron, poking about in the flooded paddy fields. Hot but pleasant. And flat. I felt the benefit of two days rest! I should do that more often.</p>

<p>After the rice came orange groves, though the trees didn't seem to be carrying many oranges. The occasional overripe fruit still clinging to the tree (or lying, rotting, beneath it). </p>

<p>The plan was for a short day, to stop in Almussafes where there was accommodation, rather than than head for the end of the first (for walkers) stage, a taxing distance of 38 kilometres walking on hard roads &ndash; and where there was no accommodation. (Not exactly true; there was an albergue with six bunks but it needed booking a couple of days in advance and I didn't feel the need for a dormitory and associated lack of privacy, if there were any pilgrims staying there. It was probably a bit late in the year to be heading out on foot to Santiago. Probably a bit late for heading out on a slow cycling camino, too!). But the Mediterranean diversion meant that Almussafes would have involved backtracking. So, I made it to a hotel in Alzira, a handful of kilometres past the end of the 'official' first stage.</p>

<p>A multitude of markers. The yellow arrows indicate the route is a camino, in this case the Camino Levante. The red and white stripes that it is a GR &ndash; a long-distance route &ndash; and the damaged sticker on the top tells us that we're on the Camino El Cid.</p>

<p>Dinner? I've been struggling to eat and a change seems in order: last night's ramen had been a good choice. Tonight Chinese? Hot and sour soup is on the menu! The restaurant has some very mixed reviews so I hope this isn't a mistake.</p>
