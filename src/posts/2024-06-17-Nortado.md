  <p>A good breakfast at this idiosyncratic accommodation, attended to by the couple who owned or run the place. In the panoramic location in the 'garden shed' dining room. There was disturbing looking news on the TV but, in Portuguese, I was at a bit of a loss. Putin and Ukraine, that much was obvious. Then I learned that the lady of the house was from Ukraine. I can't imagine what it feels like to be watching horrific scenes from one's home country.</p>

  <p>My route left down a rocky, steep road that looked tricky and harder than I needed so I took the adjacent smoothly surfaced road and sped down the hill. And let Wahoo guide me back to the route. As my accommodation was off the EV1 that I was roughly following, all routes were a bit arbitrary. North towards Lisboa and close to the coast was all that mattered.</p>

<p>I met another elderly pedaller, going in the opposite direction. Tanned, wizened and German. Leaner and more hardcore-looking than me, but that's a low bar :) Riding a Pinion-geared bicycle! What are those odds?</p>

<p>There were some hikers on a coastal path here. The 'Fisherman's Trail,' is about 230 kilometres in length and generally takes about two weeks. I was finding the going dusty and hot; I wouldn't want to be walking it now, in mid-June. It would be more fun in the spring or fall.</p>

<p>The Fisherman's Trail, and the EV1, continued along a narrow, deep sandy path so I decided on a more rideable alternative one hundred yards inland.</p>
