<p>I had hoped for a rest day after the previous day's efforts but, being Saturday night, my hotel was fully booked. I had booked a hotel a short distance on. So, a semi-rest day.</p>
<p>I woke early but was in no rush so slept some more. Then a leisurely breakfast &ndash; tortilla, ham on a slice of bread, and two large caf&eacute;s con leche. I finally got on with my ride at about 1:30 pm. </p>

<p>A more relaxed landscape south of the pass but very pleasant nonetheless. Long sleeves today since my arms were a bit red from the long day yesterday. Probably drier here but still, at this time of year, quite green. </p>

<p>Quiet roads and quiet lanes. Some uphill, not really necesitating shade breaks but taken anyway. Although my knees and ankle had come through the previous days efforts fairly unscathed, I definitely was suffering from a full-body weariness. The sun felt hot but that might have been due to my general state of low energy.</p>

<p>It was splendid to get horizontal, in the cool of my room. Still no elevator but only on the first floor! I watched Crystal Palace beat Manchester City in the FA Cup Final, and then it was time to head into town to eat. I found a quiet, cheap little bar for a sandwich and a beer. And managed quite fine, with my back (deliberately) to the Eurovision song contest on the TV.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.cycle.travel">cycle.travel</a> offers several route-finding options: any, paved, gravel. The only obvious difference between <em>any</em> and <em>gravel</em> for today's route appeared to be the approach to the Via Verde. I began to doubt my choice of gravel when faced with a kilometre of high grass, occasional muddy puddles. But the puddles weren't to deep or muddy and I stayed upright. It clearly hadn't been driven or ridden in a while but I managed without embarrassing myself. Not that it would have mattered; there wasn't an audience.</p>

<p>Once on the trail, it was plain sailing. Hard-packed surface. No navigation to contend with: just follow the trail.</p>

  <p>The day was relatively easy physically although my body was feeling the effects of the previous days. It'll take a while to get fitness and strength back into my legs. I'm way behind my levels for this time last year, but I don't have the benefit of a recent tour of Sri Lanka. It'll come. Or it won't. Meanwhile, on I plod! </p>
