<p>I had hoped for a rest day after the previous day's efforts but, being Saturday night, my hotel was fully booked. I had booked a hotel a short distance on. So, a semi-rest day.</p>
<p>I woke early but was in no rush so slept some more. Then a leisurely breakfast &ndash; tortilla, ham on a slice of bread, and two large caf&eacute;s con leche. I finally got on with my ride at about 1:30 pm. </p>
<p>A more relaxed landscape south of the pass but very pleasant nonetheless. Long sleeves today since my arms were a bit red from the long day yesterday. Probably drier here but still, at this time of year, quite green. Quiet roads and quiet lanes. Some uphill, not really necesitating shade breaks but taken anyway. Although my knees and ankle had come through the previous days efforts fairly unscathed, I definitely was suffering from a full-body weariness. The sun felt hot but that might have been due to mmy general state of low energy.</p>
<p>It was splendid to get horizontal, in the cool of my room. Still no elevator but only on the first floor! I watched Crystal Palace beat Manchester City in the FA Cup Final, and then it was time to head into town to eat.</p>
