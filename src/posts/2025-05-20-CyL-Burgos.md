<p>I had hoped for a rest day after the previous day's efforts but, being Saturday night, my hotel was fully booked. I had booked a hotel a short distance on. So, a semi-rest day.</p>
<p>I woke early but was in no rush so slept some more. Then a leisurely breakfast &ndash; tortilla, ham on a slice of bread, and two large caf&eacute;s con leche. I finally got on with my ride at about 1:30 pm. </p>

<p>A more relaxed landscape south of the pass but very pleasant nonetheless. Long sleeves today since my arms were a bit red from the long day yesterday. Probably drier here but still, at this time of year, quite green. </p>

<p>Quiet roads and quiet lanes. Some uphill, not really necesitating shade breaks but taken anyway. Although my knees and ankle had come through the previous days efforts fairly unscathed, I definitely was suffering from a full-body weariness. The sun felt hot but that might have been due to my general state of low energy.</p>

<p>It was splendid to get horizontal, in the cool of my room. Still no elevator but only on the first floor! I watched Crystal Palace beat Manchester City in the FA Cup Final, and then it was time to head into town to eat. I found a quiet, cheap little bar for a sandwich and a beer. And managed quite fine, with my back (deliberately) to the Eurovision song contest on the TV.</p>
