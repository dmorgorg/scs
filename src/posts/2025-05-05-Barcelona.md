  <p>It's been a while since my last trip. Not counting the one to England in the autumn of 2024. I had arrived home in Canada in early August, but then my mum went into hospital, and I was soon back in England. Mum was released from hospital but the worse for wear: she'd hardly got out of bed for five or six weeks and had weakened considerably. She now had a hospital bed squeezed into small living and dining area of her flat, carers came to visit four times a day to feed and to change her and I stayed in the flat while she settled back into her routine. </p>
  <p>We had a bad start: as soon as Mum was brought home she decided she wanted to go to the bathroom under her own steam &ndash; I tried to help but as soon as she tried to leave the bed, her legs buckled, and I couldn't support her. We were both on the floor, Mum helpless and myself wondered how to wind back the clock a few seconds. I did eventually manage to lift her back onto her bed but it wasn't elegant, not particularly safe, nor totally painfree for Mum.</p>
  <p>MUM TO HOME, DEATH, FUNERAL, BACK TO CANADA IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS</p>
  <p>Finally back home for a stretch, I got some medical stuff sorted. Sort of. X-rays for knees and ankle followed by MRIs on the same. Privately. This meant I had to pay but the alternative was a wait of about eighteen months. I had lost only a little weight after my four and a half thousand kilometres on the bike and then the time in the UK, caring for Mum, packed more than that back on. I was as heavy as I'd ever been. Clearly, riding wasn't going to solve the issue so I talked to my GP about Ozempic &ndash; he was very enthusiastic &ndash; and we had to jump through a few hoops to get it covered by Alberta Health Services.</p>
