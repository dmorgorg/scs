<p>No clouds today. I went in search of a bike shop but it seemed to have been a bike tour agency that was now permanently closed. Still, it was a nice day for a wander. I headed up towards the walls that went around the city.</p>

<p>This had been a fairly strenuous day of walking for my old joints and I was pleased with how they were holding up. But, when I saw as sign offering 0.2 km down to Daroca, or 8.5 km around the perimeter, I decided not to push my luck. I took the more immediate option, which brought me down on Calle Grajera, right to my hotel. </p>

<p>A longish day, necessitated by a sparcity of accmommodation.</p>

<p>The Via Verde disappeared for a while. It seemed that the new railway followed the path of the old and, as a result, I was consigned to rough gravel roads. With more up and down than I had grown accustomed to. I was not particularly entralled.</p>

<p>Then my trail became a storm water drain, to protect the new railway line from flooding.</p>

<p>It was quite hot with open countryside and a day without much shade. But I reached Monreal del Campo and cycled a couple of kilometres further south to an industrial estate where my (very cheap) hostal was. The restaurant was closed (I had anticipated this and had enquired ahead about dinner) but had a plate of soft green beans and boiled potatoes, followed by a barbecued steak. While watching Spain play football. And checking out the local ros&eacute;</p>

<p>My GPS pointed me back towards Monreal del Campo but the lady at the hotel had said to go left, south, for breakfast. It seemed a better plan. After a two or three kilometres I noticed, just off the motorway, I saw a fuel station, hotel and a typical highway restaurant. Typically expensive, not very exciting, but fuel for the day. I sat inside, enjoying the air conditioning, with my bike in full view outside the window. </p>

<p>Then it was time for the day. Gravel to start, to join the quiet road that I was supposed to be on. Then plugging away, in the open countryside, no shade, and the up and down of country roads that were not constrained to the marginal grades that trains demanded.</p>

<p>Shadows flickered across the road and I looked up to see buzzards circling. Did they see me as a potential meal? I hope not. They seemed to have a lookout, watching me with studied disinterest, atop a nearby farm building. </p>

<p>Lots of sky, a little haze to ease the sun, and on I pressed. A cycle-tourer passed me without acknowledgement. The roadies out for a spin were more friendly. Into the 'Communidad de Teruel' while still in the autonomous community of Arag&oacute;n. </p>

<p>I was cheating a little today by not continuing alone the Via Verde. The rail trail climbed (relatively steeply for a rail line) up to the old mining town of Ojos Negros, and then there was plenty of up and down to reach the next section of Via Verde. And there was no accommodation in Ojos Negros. I could save time and effort by heading directly to the next section. This would save me a day and I was becoming more aware of the days flying past too quickly.</p>

<p>I regained a short section of Via Verde as I approached the city. Then I had to leave it to actually ride into the city, down some steep hills (that would have to be climbed to regain the Via Verde) on minor roads, then on rocky gravel, until I arrived in Teruel somewhat disheveled and pushed my bike up a steep hill to my hotel. A wearing day in the sun.</p><br/>

<p>I spent a day in Teruel, doing laundry and wandering about. There seemed to be a different style of architecture, with square towers and mosaic work.</p>

<p>I paid my seniors' rate to visit the cathedral. It did seem more interesting from the outside. I also went in to the adjoining museum (included with my cathedral ticket!) which housed mainly a collection of religious art. I did see a picture of a devil who was just like J.D.Vance and I bitterly regret not taking a photo of it, J.D. &ndash; in not only my opinion &ndash; being the most evil of all Catholics.</p>
