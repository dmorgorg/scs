<p>Anticipating a long day mainly on tarmac, I was surprised to find a section of Via Verde shortly after leaving Calatayud.</p>

<p>It looked fairly overgrown, and there was a dirt road running alongside, so I went with the dirt road.</p>

<p>All too soon, after about five kilometres, the dirt came to an end and I was forced on the the N234 once again. For most of the day. I plodded along, the route a fairly consistent but moderate climb. As the elevation detail of my route map had promised. Towns, with more empty, abandoned houses than occupied, every few kilometres. Through Maluenda, with its ruined castle on the skyline and its local wine.</p>

<p>I stopped in the shade of a tree to take a drink from my water-bottle. It is fortunate that I did, otherwise I would not have noticed the deer on the hillside above me.</p>

<p>The day was overcast and humid. I worked away, hugging the crash barrier on the narrow shoulder when cars rushed past. Being Spanish, they were always considerate and gave me as much room as they could. </p>

<p>The forecast had indicated a severe chance of thunderstorms and there was a constant rumbling behind me. Large drops of rain but never really amounting to much. Impressive lightning ahead. I reached the steeper section of the route and I plodded, riding at walking pace uphill. At a sideroad, I stopped to change my sunshirt for a long-sleeved Merino layer, put my rainjacket on, and dug out my flashing rearlight from the depths of my handlebar bag. And began to walk. </p>

<p>Grape vines in the foreground but I couldn't tell what, if anything, was planted in the distance.</p>

<p>With still some climbing to the summit, I saw signs for a side road to Murero. Murero is where the next section of Via Verde started but I couldn't get cycle.travel to take me there. It insisted on taking me to a road further along the N234, and then down to join the Via Verde from there. But this looked promising. It would get me away from the main road, away from the traffic (which wasn't bad, really) and might even bring the downhill on sooner. </p>

<p>On this new route, I had a much closer look at those green fields I had seen earlier. Grain, of some sort, but growing over 1.2 m in height. And planted on steep fields that did not look very combine-harvester friendly.</p>

<p>Some inevitable climbing, into pines, and then down through deciduous trees towards the start of the next section of Via Verde.</p>

<p>The downhill required more forceful application of brakes than was generally required. This was accompanied by a rapid clanking from my rear brake. The noise was reminiscent of my rear disc rotor deterioration last year approaching Portugal.</p>

<p>Quickly off the bike, I upended it and span the wheel: everything seemed to be working well. When I applied the rear brake, it stopped the wheel as it should. No clanking, but it wasn't under any load in this position.</p>

<p>The rotor seemed fine. So far. All I could assume was that applying the brake under load caused something to flex, maybe the frame or the rotor itself, so that part of the brake caliper came in contact with the six 'spokes' of the rotor that connect the centre of the rotor to it's continuous outer bearing surface for the disc pad.</p>

<p>I made so minor position adjustments to the caliper but, when back on the bike, the problem remained. I'll have to remember to go easy on the rear brake unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Murero appeared a typical sleepy, deserted village. Three ancients, sitting outside a bar, watched me pedal past without expression. I found the Via Verde, after a wrong turn and some backtracking, and headed towards Daroca. The rain started to come down more steadily, and puddles were developing in the tracks of the double track I was riding along. The arched entrance gate in the medieval walls encircling Daroca came none too soon.</p>

<p>I rode along the cobbles, looking for the turn to my hotel. And missed it. Then I found the street, and pushed my bike up the hill towards the hotel. Water channeling down the road washed my feet effectively.</p><br/>

<p>No clouds today. I went in search of a bike shop but it seemed to have been a bike tour agency and permanently closed. Still, it was a nice day for a wander. I headed up towards the walls that went around the city.</p>
