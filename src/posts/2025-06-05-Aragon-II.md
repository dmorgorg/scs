<p>No clouds today. I went in search of a bike shop but it seemed to have been a bike tour agency that was now permanently closed. Still, it was a nice day for a wander. I headed up towards the walls that went around the city.</p>

<p>This had been a fairly strenuous day of walking for my old joints and I was pleased with how they were holding up. But, when I saw as sign offering 0.2 km down to Daroca, or 8.5 km around the perimeter, I decided not to push my luck. I took the more immediate option, which brought me down on Calle Grajera, right to my hotel. </p>

<p>A longish day, necessitated by a sparcity of accmommodation.</p>

<p>The Via Verde disappeared for a while. It seemed that the new railway followed the path of the old and, as a result, I was consigned to rough gravel roads. With more up and down than I had grown accustomed to. I was not particularly entralled.</p>

<p>Then my trail became a storm water drain, to protect the new railway line from flooding.</p>

<p>It was quite hot with open countryside and a day without much shade. But I reached Monreal del Campo and cycled a couple of kilometres further south to an industrial estate where my (very cheap) hostal was. The restaurant was closed (I had anticipated this and had enquired ahead about dinner) but had a plate of soft green beans and boiled potatoes, followed by a barbecued steak. While watching Spain play football. And checking out the local ros&eacute;</p>
