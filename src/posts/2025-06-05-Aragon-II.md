<p>No clouds today. I went in search of a bike shop but it seemed to have been a bike tour agency that was now permanently closed. Still, it was a nice day for a wander. I headed up towards the walls that went around the city.</p>

<p>This had been a fairly strenuous day of walking for my old joints and I was pleased with how they were holding up. But, when I saw as sign offering 0.2 km down to Daroca, or 8.5 km around the perimeter, I decided not to push my luck. I took the more immediate option, which brought me down on Calle Grajera, right to my hotel. </p>
