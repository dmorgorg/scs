<p>I was full of apprehension for this day. It wasn't particularly far but it was a steady uphill all the way, looking at the elevation map. And M&eacute;rida was going up to 39C, so it was going to be a very hot one. As it turned out, it wasn't particularly taxing. Maybe a hint of a tailwind? Maybe the benefit of a day's rest?</p>

<p>That said, it was a bland day. A climb out of M&eacute;rida, then N630 all the way. Close to the autovia, A66. More traffic than I've become accustomed to. No memorable scenery but a few more kilometres put away. It was a mere 36C when I arrived in Zafra. According to my Weather Underground App, it also felt like 36C. Better than those 36C days in Sri Lanka that felt like 42C. </p>

  <p>I have been a bit intimidated by the forecasts of hot weather &ndash; should an plump old guy be out cycling all day with the temperature in the high 30s? Probably not. But it hasn't felt too bad so far.</p>

  <p>I'm also trying to decide on my route. The Via Ruta de la Plata continues to, and ends in, Sevilla. The Eurovelo 1 (the Atlantic Coast Route) cuts the corner to avoid Sevilla and heads directly Huelva, on the coast by the Portuguese border. Where it is about ten degrees cooler.</p>

  <p>Due south to Seville for two or three days, then due west for a couple of days to Huelva had been my original, long-term plan. But, judging by my recent experience in M&eacute;rida, I'm not excited by seeing the sights when it's very hot. A Sevilla is a large city, another strike against it. I'd save about 100 km, following the EV1 to Huelva. And any time I did spend sight-seeing in Sevilla. </p>

  <p>Accommodation, unfortunately, looks trickier on the more direct route. Also, it is the weekend, which always reduces the rooms available. I couldn't find anything for Saturday night but there is always the albergue option &ndash; it's hard to imagine them full. This combination of uncertainties, combined with some tiredness, was increasing my anxiety levels, a condition that has been wonderfully absent so far. </p>

  <p>Monesterio is only 50 km down the road, with an elevation gain of five or six hundred metres which should be within my grasp. There was a room for Friday night and I could hope for some hotel not on booking.com, or an albergue if still on the VDLP, for wherever I ended up on Saturday night. My Zafra hotel, according to booking.com, is full on Friday and Saturday</p>

  <p>I checked at the counter and, with a room change, they could accommodate me until the weekend rush was over. So, problem delayed if not totally solved. A couple of days to take it easy, then head out on Sunday. Not a very exciting plan but helps to manage my stress levels. I might even get this blog caught up!</p>

<p>
  On the road by 8:30; I had been aiming for 8 a.m. so not too bad!  Out of Zafra on cobbles, then on a country lane road. Very pleasant. I stopped for breakfast in a shady park: some chocolate-filled cakey things, and some kiwi and lime juice (from Lidl) to take the edge off.

<p>
    After a few kilometres, I rejoined the 630. Not much traffic. Riding through a grain-growing region.

<p>And into Monesterio. I had the option of making it a long day, but possibly incurring an extra but necessary rest day, or stopping here. I checked into El Pila, a basic but clean hotel with a basic but clean room, a single bed and a shower that I could just squeeze into sideways.</p>

<p>I was out in time for a late Sunday lunch in a classy looking but reasonably priced restaurant. It was full &ndash; I was lucky to find a table &nbsp; of people in their Sunday best. Me, not so much.</p>

<p>Nice wine. A salad of poached eggs and chorizo on a bed of fresh (of course) oranges. Cod for the second course. And tiramisu and coffee to finish. The coffee to counteract the effects of the very nice wine.</p>

<blockquote>
  Getting behind on my evening note-taking for days' events, I sometimes resorted to using the voice-to-text capabilities of my phone, dictating into a note application. These can take a bit of effort to comprehend. "Tiramisu for prostrate" had me puzzled until I realised I spoken "...for postre," the Spanish word for dessert. It might have been my pronunciation but I prefer to think my phone was looking for an English word.
</blockquote>

<p>
  Then a nice wander around Monesterio...

<p>Out of my room around nine in the morning having found it very hard to get out of bed. A short day in store and I seem to go for laziness at the start of the day rather than the end. I've been like that for seventy years so I doubt it's ever going to change.</p>

<p>The lady cleaning the rooms got her keys out to open the garage door so I could extract my bike. "Mas tarde" I said (Later?) and I was understood. "Desayunos" (Breakfast) and she knew I was off in search of something to eat before setting off.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed, out on the main street, was that the town workers emptying the garbage bins were women, wearing quite short shorts and hi-vis vests. Later, the person emptying the large bins into the back of a garbage truck was also a woman, this one more conventionally clothed.</p>

<p>The place across the road that I'd noticed the previous evening was still closed. I wandered back in the direction of the bar where I'd enjoyed a couple of beers the night before. On the way, I noticed a few old men sitting outside a bar, one already into the brandy by the looks of it. I went in and ordered breakfast: caf&eacute; con leche and toast. With a sort of tomato pur&eacute;e and olive oil served to put on the toast. Then a second coffee.</p>

<p>It was nice sitting there, watching the old folk watching people pass. I could have settled in for a day of people watching myself but I had booked a room ahead so I had to get moving.</p>

<p>And a pleasant day it was. Quiet riding, still cool, onto gravel and some downhill. Then tarmac but still a quiet road, then a turn I almost missed watching the countryside roll by instead of keeping my eyes on my map! A quick turn around, to push up half a dozen high steps (there was a yellow arrow, pointing at me, to let me know I was on the Camino) to join the N-630. </p>

  src="/images/2024/06/2024-06-03-101707.jpg"
  alt="out of Monesterio"
/>

<p> I left the N-630 for a gravel shortcut, one side of a triangle (my road route specified the other two sides) that led more directly to El Read de la Jara. It would have been a shame to have missed this section: kilometres (around ten?) of beautiful riding through beautiful countryside and still quite a pleasant temperatue. A cycle-tourist passed going north. A couple of vehicles passed. An especially lovely hour or so.</p>

<p>At El Real de la Jara, some ruined castles. Then more quiet road. Up and down but nothing too vicious. I even took pleasure in some of the (up)hills!</p>

<p>The hotel in Almad&eacute;n de la Plata is nice, too. 35&euro; through booking.com; would it have been 30 if I'd just showed up? That seemed to have been the deal in Monesterio. But I wanted to make sure I had a room so it was worth the possible extra charge for peace of mind. </p>

<p>I had a basic lunch at the hotel and chatted with a German cyclist. He lives in Bali, Indonesia, but is on a cycling holiday, travelling lightly on an electric full-suspension mountain bike.</p>

<p>A siesta, then a slow wander around town. Village? Not very large, at any rate.</p>
