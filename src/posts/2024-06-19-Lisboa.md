  distance="91.0 km, 741 m, 3719.7km to date"

<blockquote>There are two separate recorded rides for this day. I turned off my computer for the afternoon ferry crossing. The first ride ended at Troia, the embarkation point for the ferry to Set&uacute;bal and the second started where I disembarked in Set&uacute;bal.</blockquote>

    alt="cork pile"

  <p>I'd seen small trucks carrying loads of this material, and trees with their bark removed up to a height of around four metres. I had no idea what it was, also noticing it in drying piles like this one. I finally decided it must be cork.</p>

   <p>I was now riding north on a narrow peninsula. A long, straight paved road, more traffic, and With rice paddy fields alongside. The Atlantic is on the far side of the sand dunes, to the west.</p>

  <p>And, still, storks aplenty.</p>

  <p>And then I was at the ferry across towards Lisboa.</p>

  <p>A couple of friendly people at the gate took my money for the ferry &ndash; 5.40&euro; for myself and 5.40&euro; for my bike &ndash; and I followed the road to the pier. The ferry arrived after fifteen or so minutes and I rolled on. </p>

    alt="waiting for the ferry"

  <p>A short crossing and then a roll off to Set&uacute;bal. Accommodation seemed neither economical nor close so I decided to press on in the direction of Lisboa. A stiff pull up a hill, on a road busier than I would have like, over the bay and I rested at a pullout to refuel on bread and cheese. Always bread and cheese!</p>

  <p>Then steep downhill and off on a quieter narrow side road</p>

  <p>You can see the results of harvest the cork from the lower trunk and branches of these trees.</p>

  <p>The last part of the day was hard going. But I made it to accommadation in a built up suburb south of Lisboa. I wasn't sure I'd found the right place; it looked just like an ordinary residence. Which it was. A man and his daughter welcomed me into a room in their house, leaving the bike padlocked to a railing outside. It all felt a little strange but I had a shower, paid to man for laundry and set of in search of dinner. The restaurant the man suggested was closed (Monday?) and I ended up walking quite a long way to find food. </p>

<p>110 metres high, inspired by the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, built as a plea to God to release Portugal from entering World War II.</p>

<p>Another day, another ferry. But this was a short stretch of water to cross.</p>

    alt="a ferry to Lisboa"

<p>I made my way to Lisbon Cathedral, paid my entrance fee, got my pilgrim's passport stamped and had a quick look around. I didn't want to spend to long as my bike was locked to a railing outside, with panniers and the rest accessible.</p>

</div>

<p>Then it was time to leave the capital and head for quieter scenes. Rural escape was not quite immediate.</p>

<p>And then there were Camino signs to welcome me along the route.</p>
